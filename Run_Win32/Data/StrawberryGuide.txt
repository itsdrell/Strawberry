Key:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I use automation to export from this so this is what these mean 
    square brackets are areas I wanna take function info from 
    - descriptions of functions 
    * are parameters
    < are return values

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Console Commands:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
` Toggles the console!
- When a project is loaded, F5 is a quick reload

    help
        - Shows all the commands

    cls
        - Clears the console text

    quit
        - Closes Strawberry (does not save)

    create <ProjectName>
        - Creates a new project and all the defaul assets
        - Lives under "Projects/ProjectName"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input

- Input takes a Keycode. A keycode can be:
    1. A character. An example "a"
    2. Name of a key. Example "space"

Current Named Keys are:
    Space Key is:           "space"
    Left Shift Key is:      "lshift
    Enter Key is:           "enter"
    BackSpace Key is:       "backspace"
    Left Arrow Key is:      "left"
    Right Arrow Key is:     "right"
    Up Arrow Key is:        "up"
    Down Key is:            "down"

Mouse:
    - For the name of the button use "left" or "right" to specify which click you want

- Input currently only supports the named keys listed above as well as any letter key 

[
    IsKeyPressed ( KeyCode )
        - Checks if a key is being held down
	    * Keycode : Ex would be "a" for a key

    WasKeyJustPressed ( KeyCode )
        - Checks if the key was just pressed down during that frame

]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Music/SFX

Music supports all audio types but .wav and .mp3 are ideal! 
This is for songs you want to have looped!

You can create subfolders in here but in lua you will have to 
add the folders to the path when using the lua functions

    Ex. You made a folder call PlayerSounds
    Music/PlayerSounds/theCoolSound.wav

    In Lua you would call the sounds like:
    PlayMusic("PlayerSounds/theCoolSound.wav")

    instead of 
    PlayMusic("theCoolSound.wav") -- DOES NOT WORK

Audio Functions:
[
    PlayOneShot( nameOfFile, volume )
        - Plays a SFX (or music!) ONCE. This is non looping

    PlayMusic( nameOfFile, volume )
        - Plays music that is looped

    StopMusic( nameOfFile )
        - Stops the music from playing it's loop
]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Functions will do the math for you under the hood

    TODO: explain map and collision editor

[
    DrawMap()
        - Call this in Draw() if you want the map to be drawn 

    SetTileSprite(x,y,spriteIndex)
        - Changes the sprite of a tile on the map 
        * x,y : are in world position not tile pos. It will figure the tilePos out for you
        * spriteIndex : sprite to use from the spritesheet

    GetTileSprite(x,y)
        - Gets the sprite index of a tile based on a world position
        * x,y : are in world position not tile pos. It will figure the tilePos out for you
        < returns a int representing the sprite index 

    DoesTileHaveCollision(x,y,channelToCheck)
        - checks if a tile has a certain collision flag
        * channelToCheck is 1-16 based on a combinations of bits set in the editor
        < returns a bool 
]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Curves

    - You can create curves in the Curve Editor (4 key in editor mode)
    - Allows you to make simple NORMALIZED (time 0->1) curves. 
    - You can have up to 10 of them and you can reference them by their number

[
    EvaluateCurve(curveIndex, t)
        * CurveIndex specifies which curve to use based on their index in the editor
        * t is a number between 0,1 describing how far into the curve we are time wise
        < returns the evaluated value for that curve based on how long into the curve t specifies

Helper classes
    - Strawberry offers some helper classes to make life easier. 
    - They also are used to interface with the Berry library (see below)

Berry 

    - Berry is a namespace that wraps all of the normal functions but allows you to 
        use the utility classes as parameter 
    
    Ex. Instead of DrawAABB2(x,y, xx, yy, color) its just Berry.DrawAABB2(box, color)

    - Also some more specific utils (like collision) that you may not want to use (but I do :)
