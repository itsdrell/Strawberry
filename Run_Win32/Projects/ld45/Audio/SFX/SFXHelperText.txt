SFX supports all audio types but .wav and .mp3 are ideal! 
This is for sfx that are just played once!

You can create subfolders in here but in lua you will have to 
add the folders to the path when using the lua functions

Ex. You made a folder call PlayerSounds
Music/PlayerSounds/theCoolSound.wav

In Lua you would call the sounds like:
PlayMusic("PlayerSounds/theCoolSound.wav")

instead of 
PlayMusic("theCoolSound.wav") -- DOES NOT WORK
